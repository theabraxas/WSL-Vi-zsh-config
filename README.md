# WSL-Vi-zsh-config
Optimize WSL bash for zsh, vi code completion, color scheme and more!

I'm going to try to start with this config walkthrough here: http://jessicadeen.com/tech/microsoft/badass-terminal-fcu-wsl-edition-oh-my-zsh-powerlevel9k-tmux-and-more/ 

Ideally I want to fix a few things - the  UbuntuMono NF font has multiple versions and sometimes causes errors, this is focused on devs, I want to make it a bit more focused on hacking things, I want to change some of the behaviors in WSL-terminal, etc. regarding copy/paste and so forth.
